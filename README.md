# Expectation Targets based on the Meeting after Next

## Sequences:

The sequences are generated by sequence.py.

This can be invoked by ** python sequence.py **

The code can be modified to calculate the combinations for n-th next meeting by changing the 2 in the main function into other numbers. 

## Future Contracts to Use:

This is written in **contracts_meeting_after_next.pdf**. The implementation is in **exptarg2.rpf**
